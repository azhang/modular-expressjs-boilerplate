modular-expressjs-boilerplate
=============================

Node/Express boilerplate using modules


This project is inspired by the lack of examples for writing a modular Nodejs/Express app. The goal is to make it easier to start projects of all sizes, whether for a hackathon, or for production software.

Also inspired by sahat/hackathon-starter.
